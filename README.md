### Local Development (Required)

It is more powerful and flexible to have a local development environment. It is also a LOT more work than using online developer tools, especially on Windows.

NOTE: The online/remote tools may be sufficient for your needs.

Confirm the following

`Install XCode (Mac Users)`
`Install Android Studio (All Users)`
`Install 1 device emulator`
`Install expo-cli`
`Create google play and apple developer accounts`

### First Phone App

- What it does and how it looks is up to you. This is an opportunity to play around with whats possible in React Native and to get a feel for how you can get into the various device features.

- This is a 2-session assignment, after which you will live-demo your phone app to the class (at the start of class 43)

1. Lab/Coding Session #1 - Focus on getting your dev system up and operational, getting “proof of life” and reaching your MVP in terms of baseline functionality

2. Lab/Coding Session #2 - Add in the device features, polish, and prepare for deployments.
